operating system that guarantees real-time characteristics through tasks
scheduling and timer management.

Task (Task): A single unit of work executed within the system, managed
by an RTOS, and scheduled among tasks.

Scheduling (Scheduling): The process of determining the execution order
of tasks within the system. In real-time systems, scheduling is based on
appropriate priorities and deadlines.

Event-Driven (Event-Driven): A processing method where system operations
respond to events triggered externally. Tasks execute upon receiving
events.

Interrupt (Interrupt): A mechanism where an RTOS temporarily suspends
the execution of a task in response to notifications from HW or SW,
allowing interrupt handling.

Timer (Timer): A device or function that generates events at regular
intervals. Used for task scheduling and periodic processing in real-time
systems.

System Clock (System Clock): A clock signal that controls the timing of
the entire system, used for various timing-related operations.

efficient concurrent processing.

Blocking: The act of preventing other processes from proceeding until a
process is complete. Blocking occurs in operations such as I/O or
waiting until necessary data or conditions are met.

Queue: A data structure used to temporarily store data or tasks. Data is
added to and removed from the queue according to the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) principle.

Inter-Process Communication (IPC): The means of exchanging data or
information between different processes. It is achieved using shared
memory, pipes, sockets, etc.

are cases where Embedded Real-Time Systems are also utilized.
Specifically, Embedded Real-Time Systems may be employed in the
following scenarios:

Applications Requiring Real-Time Performance:

-   Smartphones feature applications that demand real-time performance,
    > such as audio/video processing, real-time sensor data processing,

-   Smartphones require low-latency communication for applications like
    > real-time voice/video calls and online gaming. Embedded Real-Time
    > Systems may be utilized as part of the network stack or
    > communication protocols for such purposes.

Hence, while Embedded Linux primarily serves as the base for
smartphones, Embedded Real-Time Systems may coexist in certain
functionalities or applications.

**[● User]{.underline}**

All smartphones are equipped with a baseband chip, but what operating
system runs on it?

**[● ChatGPT]{.underline}**

Most smartphones contain a baseband chip responsible for communication
functions (such as calls and data transmission) and an application
processor (typically ARM architecture) that provides general
applications and user interfaces. The baseband chip processes
communication protocols and interfaces with the communication network.

On the other hand, the operating system running on the application
processor is typically a mobile OS like Android or iOS. These OSs manage
application execution, user interaction, and device control.

**[● User]{.underline}**

The baseband chip processes communication protocols and interfaces with
the communication network. What OS does the program of the communication
protocol run on?

**[● ChatGPT]{.underline}**

The processing of communication protocols is handled by firmware (FW) or
real-time operating systems (RTOS) embedded within the baseband chip.
These RTOS or FW are optimized to perform communication processing
quickly and in real-time. Typically, these systems have lightweight and
efficient kernels tailored to meet real-time requirements and are
closely integrated with the HW.

For instance, the baseband chip supports various communication standards
like GSM, CDMA, and LTE, each with dedicated firmware to handle their
respective communication protocols. This firmware usually runs on top of
an RTOS and ensures real-time performance and efficiency in
communication processing.

**[● User]{.underline}**

Based on the above, ChatGPT has been saying that \"Applications
requiring real-time performance, such as communication processing and
baseband control, are handled by the Embedded Real-Time System.\" Even
if it\'s a low-cost or general-purpose smartphone, it always has a
baseband chip. Therefore, isn\'t it the case that all smartphones are
products where Embedded Linux and Embedded Real-Time Systems always
coexist?

**[● ChatGPT]{.underline}**

Indeed, for smartphones, Embedded Real-Time Systems are necessary to
handle functions such as communication processing and baseband control,
even for low-cost or general-purpose devices. Since all smartphones are
equipped with a baseband chip, which handles functions requiring
real-time performance, it can be said that Embedded Linux and Embedded
Real-Time Systems coexist in all smartphones. Therefore, smartphones can
be considered products where Embedded Linux and Embedded Real-Time
Systems always coexist.
